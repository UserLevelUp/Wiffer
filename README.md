Windows Differential

Users select a window to add or remove it from the Windows Selector collection.  Any can be tracked during a session to exam and build a time based differential based on the optimum even timing when change detection or noticed on the screen such as 10 milliseconds or ever 5 seconds depending on the needs of a user.   The results will be stored on a per windows basis.  So the image of the window that is changing will be logged.  No changes it will only log no changes or null for that iteration.

Why is the useful?  This can be very useful in maintaining synchronous logs for note taking, debugging seesion, or monitoring session where time based notes need to match time based image or imagery.

Differences in a screen or window snapshot will be compared with previous snapshots based on a treed cpature of the window or windows and their contents and state whether they are open or closed or minimized etc..
The result can be captured in an xml or json file that can help build a clear run down in the format desired with some standard ones that come with the open source project.

The technology will depend on any language or platform that can handle these types of requirements on a windows or linux platform.  

Currently this project is in the idea stages.
